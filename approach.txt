This script synchronizes data from a Google Sheets document to a MySQL database. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

    Google Sheets Authentication: It uses Google OAuth2 to authenticate and access the Google Sheets API.
    MySQL Connection: Establishes a connection to a local MySQL database (superjoin) and fetches existing records from a table (users).
    Data Fetching: It retrieves the data (name and email) from Google Sheets at regular intervals.
    Sync Logic:
        Compares the Google Sheets data with the existing MySQL records.
        Inserts new records, updates existing ones if names have changed, and deletes records from MySQL if they no longer exist in Google Sheets.
    Continuous Syncing: The script runs in a loop, syncing the data every 6 seconds.

This keeps the MySQL users table updated with changes from Google Sheets in near real-time.
